ZEROTH project:
in arduino, enter a number from 0 to 180 in the serial monitor and more the servo to that angle

FIRST PROJECT:
user enters a number in the python terminal
python reads this number, sends it to arduino serially
arduino reads this number, sends it back to python
python reads this number, prints it to terminal


SECOND PROJECT:
same as first but arduino moves the servo to the angle 0 to 180
